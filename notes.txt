Taks:
1. Recode variables and prepare data for models. 
2. Create a function to run models and save results. 

Questions: 
1. We are doing a network analysis of behaviors. We should compare network structures  
    by race/ethnicity
    by gender
    by age

Define a good method of comparison. Be careful of using centrality measures because of network of correlations. 
Stablish criteria for dichotomizing the network and compare structures. 
Criteria can be based on: 
- Median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile.
- All possible values (as tree methods) and sensitivity analysis.
